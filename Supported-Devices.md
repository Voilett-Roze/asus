Asuswrt-Merlin is available in two separate branches:

- The original (legacy) Asuswrt-Merlin (up to version 380.xxx)
- The new generation (current) branch (version 382.xxx and newer)

Each branch supports different models.  As Asus upgrades models to the new 382/384 code base, they will gradually be migrated to Asuswrt-Merlin's new gen branch, with the exception of the RT-N66U and RT-AC66U which will remain on the legacy 380 branch (see [Issue #164](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/issues/164#issuecomment-434465442) for an explanation of why these models are difficult to support).
Development has been abandoned for the legacy branch.

No longer supported:
 * RT-N16
 * RT-AC56U

NOTE: all the "R" versions (for example RT-N66R) are the same as their "U" counterparts, they are just different packages aimed at large retailers.  The firmware is 100% compatible with both U and R versions of the routers.  Same with the "W" variants that are simply white.
