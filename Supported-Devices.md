Asuswrt-Merlin is available in two separate branches:

- The original (legacy) Asuswrt-Merlin (up to version 380.xxx)
- The new generation (current) branch (version 382.xxx and newer)

The Legacy branch is no longer being developed, and should not be used anymore as it's missing many recent security updates.
