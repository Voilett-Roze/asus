## Introduction
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

@GNUton maintains a docker image with the latest Asuswrt-merlin toolchains which can be used to build the firmware.  Best of all,
it's always up to date!

### Setup Docker

Directions for installing Docker are [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Pull the image and off you go!

Directions for using the image are [here](https://github.com/gnuton/Asuswrt-Merlin-Toolchains-Docker#readme), and the
