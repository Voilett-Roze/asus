# Guide to disk formatting with Asuswrt-Merlin

Learn how ASUS routers can be used to directly repartition and format attached USB disks from the command line. Follow a step-by-step guide or use a simple interactive menu-based script to automatically format disks to ext2, ext3, ext4 filesystem. Disks larger than 2TB aren't supported due to [partition table size limits](#partition-tables).

- Physical access to attach and detach disks to router USB port.
- Basic command line skills.
----
### Limitations & Important Notes

#### Partition tables
There are some compatibility issues with partition tables:
- **MBR** _'Master Boot Record'_ has best compatibility with ASUSWRT.
- **MBR** only supports maximum disk capacity 2TB (entire disk).
- **GPT** _'GUID Partition Table'_ supports disks over 2TB.
- Creating or editing a **GPT** is unfortunately not supported by **fdisk** on ASUSWRT. So devices using GPT may appear locked in **fdisk** or return a message similar to _"Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT"_. In this case the existing GPT must be replaced with an MBR. See the instructions below. Another solution is the [automatic disk formatting script](#automatic-disk-formatting-script).

> Quote: "The Master Boot Record partition table limits the maximum size of the entire disk (not just a partition) to 2TB. If you have a disk larger than this you need to use a GUID partition table (GPT). Whilst personally I always use MBR if possible for compatibility reasons, we know that Asus officially supports disks of at least 4TB, ergo they must also support GPT. But here's the rub, the router's version of fdisk doesn't support editing GPT partition tables or have the option to create them. So owners of such devices ... will have to partition them with a GPT on another device and then skip the whole of that step ..." -- ColinTaylor, posted on [SNB Forums](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/ext4-disk-formatting-options-on-the-router.48302/page-2#post-456414).

Please note: if your disk is larger than 2TB you could [install entware utility **gdisk** on router to create a GPT](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/how-to-partition-bigger-than-2tb-disk-with-gpt-and-ext4.55025/) but that is more complicated and outside the scope of this guide.

#### Unmounting disks
There are a few problems you can run into when unmounting disks by command line:

##### _Device or resource is busy_
You cannot unmount the disk if a script or process is utilizing it.
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/tmp/home/root# umount /tmp/mnt/SANDISK/
umount: can't unmount /tmp/mnt/SANDISK: Device or resource busy
```
This is a common problem and difficult to avoid if you already have scripts running on your router. We cannot advise you on what processes to kill. A better solution may be to do the following:
1. Unmount the disk from the ASUS web GUI
2. [Zero the disk to eradicate the existing partition table](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Disk-formatting#6-zero-disk)
3. Reboot the router to clear memory of the old partition table from the kernel
4. [You should then continue on from step 5 as normal](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Disk-formatting#5-unmount)

Please note:
- do not use the options `-f` or `-l` with umount because it won't help and may corrupt data.

>Quote: "The device must be properly unmounted. If the user cannot unmount the device then they shouldn't proceed. Using the -f option won't help. Do not use the -l option of umount either. This option was suggested at one point but must not be used. It will cause problems, especially with devices that have multiple partitions. There's no easy way to solve this. It's really up to the user to know what processes are currently using the device and to terminate them. The usual way of identifying such processes is with the fuser command. Unfortunately that isn't part of the normal firmware, although it is in Entware." -- ColinTaylor

##### _Ghost devices_
You may find duplicate devices get created.
- the umount command does NOT automatically remove the device mount point.
- removing the mount point must be done manually.
- failure to delete the mount point for unmounted devices can result in a confusing list of duplicate "ghost" devices and other problems.

This problem can be avoided by remembering to manually remove the directories your disk was previously mounted as.
>Quote: "When the router mounts a USB drive it creates a mount point (which is just a directory) with the appropriate name in /tmp/mnt. When you unmount that device using the GUI the router also deletes the mount point. If you unmount the device from the command line you will probably not think to also delete its mount point - that's the problem. If you now physically remove the USB device and then plug it back in the router will look in /tmp/mnt and see that there is already a mount point with the name it wants to use. To avoid mounting the USB drive over the top of (what it thinks is) another device it adds a suffix of (1) to the name it's going to use." -- ColinTaylor

#### Zero disk before creating new partition table
There are problems that can arise if you don't zero your disk before trying to overwrite it with a new partition table.
> Quote:"... 6. Zero disk should be marked as mandatory rather than optional. Yes it is dangerous, but I suppose the whole procedure could be called that. My concern is as I outlined in the [link](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/beta-amtm-v1-6_beta-now-with-disk-formatting-automated.54490/page-2#post-459430). Namely, if the device has previously been formatted with a partition table (unlike flash drives that usually are formatted without a partition table) as soon as you write the fdisk changes the router will look to see if there are any valid filesystems in the partitions. In this situation it's highly likely this will be the case so the router will mount them causing us problems in the subsequent steps.
> 
> Side note: When I was testing these scenarios for amtm I ended up in some bizarre situations, partly caused by the above. For example; first I partitioned and formatted my device as ext4. Next I used dd to wipe out just the first sector of the device, erasing the partition table. I then plugged the device into a Windows PC. Windows asks me whether I want to format it, which I do as FAT32. This puts a FAT32 header in sector 0. I remove the device from my PC and plug it into the router. The router auto-mounts it, so I unmount it. I then use fdisk again to create a new empty partition table and add one partition.
> 
> The thing to note here is that when fdisk creates the partition table it writes the relevant information at the end of sector 0. It leaves the rest of the sector unchanged! So...... If I now plug this device into a Windows PC it thinks that it's formatted as FAT32 because there is a valid header in sector 0. But if I plug the device into a Linux box it sees it as having a single partition containing an ext4 filesystem (even though we never ran mke2fs after wiping and recreating the partition table)." -- ColinTaylor

### Methods: Automatic or Manual?
There are two (2) methods of formatting disks attached to your router.
1. Automatically with the AMTM - Asus Merlin Terminal Menu script.
2. Manually by following this guide.

Beginners and experts can benefit from using the automatic script to save time and stop human error. Doing the task manually requires reading and understanding what you are doing.

---- 
## Automatic Disk Formatting Script

### amtm - the Asuswrt-Merlin Terminal Menu
 
**amtm** is a shortcut manager for popular scripts for wireless routers running on Asuswrt-Merlin firmware. It is intended to be a helper script, a convenient shortcut manager to install and manage scripts on your router.

The **fd** format disk feature was [beta tested](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/beta-amtm-v1-6_beta-now-with-disk-formatting-automated.54490/page-2#post-459430) and quickly [introduced in Update v1.6](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/amtm-the-snbforum-asuswrt-merlin-terminal-menu.42415/page-20#post-460843).

Visit the [Developer's website](https://diversion.ch/amtm.html) and the [Forum thread](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/amtm-the-snbforum-asuswrt-merlin-terminal-menu.42415/) for information.

---- 
## Manual Step-by-Step Instructions
### 1. Preparations
- The process erases all data and partitions on the device.
- Backup valuable data.
- Format disk with FAT32 filesystem before beginning to ensure it is clean and detectable by ASUSWRT firmware.
- To be on the safe side, remove all other attached USB devices from router before continuing.

Consider checking the [ASUS Plug-n-Share Disks Compatibility List](https://event.asus.com/2009/networks/disksupport/)

----
### 2. Attach USB disk

Plug your USB storage device into either the USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port.
- USB 3.0 High Speed port: best for large capacity disks typically used for sharing large media files and video streaming.
- USB 2.0 Low Speed port: suitable for small capacity flash-drives typically used only for router scripts like Diversion, Skynet, Stubby etc.

Tip: Insufficient shielding on USB ports for some router models may cause WiFi interference on the 2.4 GHz band. You may choose to enable the Reduce USB Interference option in the router Web GUI.

----
### 3. Connect to router via ssh

Login to the router via ssh using your preferred client.

To enable SSH (LAN ONLY) go to [Administration/System](http://router.asus.com/Advanced_System_Content.asp)

***Do not enable SSH for WAN or you will get hacked.***

----
### 4. View disk information

We must begin by checking the information for the attached disk. 

Things to note before continuing:
- **df** command will NOT show unmounted disks.
- **fdisk -l** command will show both mounted and unmounted disks.

**fdisk -- DOS partition maintenance program**

List the partition table for every disk, including unmounted disks:

`fdisk -l`

My example below shows **fdisk** output:
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 15.3 GB, 15376318464 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1869 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/sda1               1        1870    15014912   b Win95 FAT32
```
From my output we can see:
1. My disk is **/dev/sda**
2. It contains 1 partition, mounted as **/dev/sda1**
3. Total disk storage capacity is 15.3GB
4. Disk currently uses block size of 512 kb (the default)
5. Disk considers 1 cylinder to be 16065 blocks of 512 kb
6. Therefore 1 cylinder equals 8225280 bytes

**df -- display free disk space**

Show human-readable filesystem usage statistics for all _mounted_ disks:

`df -h`

My example below shows **df** output:
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
ubi:rootfs_ubifs         77.2M     63.9M     13.2M  83% /
mtd:bootfs                4.4M      3.3M      1.1M  75% /bootfs
mtd:data                  8.0M    576.0K      7.4M   7% /data
/dev/mtdblock8           48.0M      1.6M     46.4M   3% /jffs
/dev/sda1                14.3G      2.3M     14.3G   0% /tmp/mnt/SANDISK
```

From my output we can see:
1. **/dev/sda1** is mounted at directory **/tmp/mnt/SANDISK**
2. **sda1** currently uses the disk label **SANDISK**

**TAKE NOTE OF YOUR OWN DEVICE DETAILS.**

The information seen above will be used for all future examples.

----
### 5. Unmount

All partitions on the device **must** be _properly_ unmounted and their respective mount points manually removed BEFORE we can zero the disk, write a new MBR partition table and format with an ext2, ex3 or ex4 filesystem.

**mount** command will list mounted devices:

`mount`

My example below shows **mount** output:
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/# mount

ubi:rootfs_ubifs on / type ubifs (ro,relatime)
devtmpfs on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,relatime,mode=0755)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,relatime)
tmpfs on /var type tmpfs (rw,noexec,relatime,size=420k)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,relatime)
debugfs on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw,relatime)
mtd:bootfs on /bootfs type jffs2 (ro,relatime)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,relatime,mode=600)
mtd:data on /data type jffs2 (rw,relatime)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime)
/dev/mtdblock8 on /jffs type jffs2 (rw,noatime)
/dev/sda1 on /tmp/mnt/SANDISK type ext4 (rw,nodev,relatime)
```

From my output we can see:
1. **/dev/sda1** is mounted at directory **/tmp/mnt/SANDISK**
2. **sda1** currently uses the disk label **SANDISK**
3. **sda1** is formatted with type **ex4** filesystem

Unmounting your device can be done in two (2) different ways; using the router web GUI or using the command line. It is preferable to unmount from the web GUI for [reasons outlined in limitations section](#unmounting-disks) and then [skip to the next step and zero your disk](#6-zero-disk).

**umount** command unmounts filesystems.

My example device **SANDISK** can be unmounted with this command:

`umount /tmp/mnt/SANDISK`

Note: umount fails to work if ["device or resource is busy"](#device-or-resource-is-busy).

If the disk was unmounted properly you should no longer see it listed:

`mount`

Remember there are different ways to check mount status:
- **df** command will NOT show unmounted disks.
- **fdisk -l** command will show both mounted and unmounted disks.

**umount** does **NOT** remove obsolete mount-points for unmounted devices, so we should do it manually.

List the mount-point directories that still exist:

`ls -la /tmp/mnt`

My example below shows output listing contents located in the /tmp/mnt directory:
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/# ls -la /tmp/mnt
drwxrwxrwx    3 admin root             0 Jan 28 18:51 .
drwxrwxrwx   17 admin root             0 Jan 29 18:18 ..
drwxrwxrwx    5 admin root          4096 Jan 28 02:00 SANDISK
```

From my output we can see my unmounted device SANDISK has an obsolete mount-point.

The obsolete mount point directory is removed with these commands:

`rm /tmp/mnt/SANDISK/.autocreated-dir`

`rmdir /tmp/mnt/SANDISK`

If it was successfully removed then it won't be listed anymore:

`ls -la /tmp/mnt`

Remember, **if your device has multiple partitions** you must **repeat this step** until ALL partitions on the device have been _properly_ unmounted and their respective mount points manually removed. Then you may continue to the next step.

----
### 6. Zero disk

Before we begin creating a new partition table it is prudent to properly erase the old partition table. We can achieve this best by overwriting the beginning of the disk with 0's using a utility called **dd** data duplicator.

_Previously this step was listed as optional due to risk of data loss but further research and user feedback has shown it is essential to avoid errors when creating a new partition table. For a better explanation please read the [limitations section](#zero-disk-before-creating-new-partition-table)._

dd is affectionately nicknamed **DISK DESTROYER** because people can accidentally erase the wrong disk and lose their valuable data. It happens when mistyping the command simply by reversing the source and target disk.

To be on the safe side, remove all other attached USB devices from router before continuing.

**WARNING: RISK OF ACCIDENTAL DATA LOSS IF TYPED INCORRECTLY**.

My example disk **/dev/sda** can be zero'd with this command:

`dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda count=16065 bs=512 && sync`

You see we included two (2) options in the command: **bs** is block size in bytes and **count** is the number of blocks to write. Using the default block size of **512** bytes, multiplied by a _block count_ of **16065** we can overwrite the first 8225280 bytes of the disk with zero's. This will completely erase the old partition table and the beginning of the new partition.

From my output we can see the partition table has been removed:
```
admin@RT-AC86U:/# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 15.3 GB, 15376318464 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1869 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table
```

----
### 7. Repartition disk

**fdisk** command allows managing disk partitions. We must use it to create a new empty MDOS MBR partition table, which is [**not compatible with disks larger than 2TB**](#partition-tables).

My example device **sda** can be modified with this command:

`fdisk /dev/sda`

From interactive menu, do these commands in order:

**m** (or **help**) to see options:

`m`

**p** to see all existing partitions on disk (take note):

`p`

**o** to erase and create new disk partition table of type mdos MBR Master Boot Record:

`o`

**p** to see all partitions on disk (now we should see none):

`p`

**n** to begin making new partition:

`n`

...then **p** to make it a primary partition:

`p`

...then **1** (one) for its partition number:

`1`

...then accept default values for first and last cylinder

**p** to see all partitions on disk (now we should see 1 created of type ID 83 Linux):

`p`

**w** to write changes to disk:

`w`

----
### 8. Format and adjust filesystem features

**mke2fs** command is to create an ext2, ext3, ext4 filesystem, usually in a disk partition, where device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/sdXX ).

A few command options:
`-t` : set file system type,
`-L` : set a new volume label,
`-O` : specify a feature to use

For the commands below my example device is **sda1**. Your device may differ.

To format as ext2 filesystem:

`mke2fs -t ext2 /dev/sda1`

or use the alias ASUS built-in:

`mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1`

To format as ext3 filesystem:

`mke2fs -t ext3 /dev/sda1`

or use the alias:

`mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1`

To format as ext4 with journaling off:

`mke2fs -t ext4 -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1`

To format as ext4 with journaling on:

`mke2fs -t ext4 -O has_journal /dev/sda1`

**tune2fs** command allows to adjust various filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems.

To add or change disk label:

`tune2fs -L "yourDiskLabel" /dev/sda1`

To disable journaling on ext4:

`tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1`

To enable journaling on ext4 omit the ^:

`tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sda1`

To disable 64bit filesystem compatibility:

`tune2fs -O ^64bit /dev/sda1`

To enable 64bit filesystem compatibility omit the ^:

`tune2fs -O 64bit /dev/sda1`

----
### 9. Reboot and mount disk

Rebooting the router is highly recommended to remount the USB device. You may encounter issues with ASUSWRT if you try to mount it manually instead of rebooting.

Reboot the router with this command: 

`/sbin/reboot`

If a reboot isn't possible then try to manually mount the device. My example device sda1 with label SANDISK can be mounted with these commands:

`mkdir /tmp/mnt/SANDISK`

`mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/mnt/SANDISK`
