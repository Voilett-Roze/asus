`The Marvelous Celestial Beings Behind the 11:11 Phenomenon
Almost all of us have experienced the heart-pounding terror of lost car keys. But even worse is loosing someone else’s car keys—especially when there’s no duplicate around. You guessed it: I once experienced this hyper-embarrassing state of affairs. I felt that panic rip through me and I did perform the self-flagellations one does for such antics. Yet, thanks to the grace of higher forces, I also had a happy resolution: to my rescue came invisible beings who replaced these keys, making them appear on a surface that five of us had inspected numerous times in search of them. All of are sure it was a minor miracle.
And it gets
curiouser and curiouser, to borrow a phrase from Alice in Wonderland. For I am sure that the unseen helpers who saved me from lost-keys hell were connected to the so-called 11:11 time prompt that we have all heard about. So let me tell you about the extraordinary quasi-angelic beings called the midwayers, who I believe to be the true originators of the 11:11 phenomenon. But first hear my story of the miraculously recovered keys and their role in it.
A business associate had kindly loaned me her car while she was out of the country for a month (my car was out of state). At no cost to me, she let me use her Toyota Prius while I searched to buy a new one. I was soon to edit and publish a major book for her. Trusting me to handle things maturely, my generous friend had left me no duplicate keys. I was also busily reviewing her manuscript.
One night that month I was off visiting some old friends one hour’s drive away—when it happened. At evening’s end, the keys just disappeared. Gone. Kaput. Nowhere! Checked my pockets, again and again; checked the couch and the crevices between the cushions. Hands and knees on the floor. Heart now racing. Okay, look under all tables. In the bathroom. The kitchen! The bedroom where a few of us had talked and sat on the bed. The backyard where I had gone out for fresh air . . . We were all practically crawling through the house and the yard, and then finally giving up in exasperation. I would stay the night, and the host and I and his two roommates would search again in the morning.
After coffee the next morning, we hunt through the house, every inch, every surface. Now I am calling locksmiths. Alas, no easy way to help me since this was an electronic key to a Prius. Wandering from room to room. Heart racing again. Giving up, I finally get a ride home, as someone was heading in that direction. I get home and I am preparing emotionally to call the car’s owner in Germany, when I get this text:
Amazing!!!!! Keys on the dresser, in plain view!

Appended was a photo of the keys on a surface we had all scrutinized multiple times. What a relief! What a blessing! So, why do I think this small marvel was connected to the so-called midwayer beings, and from them to the 11:11 time prompt?
Let’s first allow one midwayer to speak. This quote is from a recent transmission received by a human contactee:
We, the Midwayers, share your space, this world, our world. We live in a different timeslot, a different frame or reality of time, however, and the differential allows us to project ourselves right through your brick walls without us hurting ourselves, or slip through a spider’s web without disturbing it, or the spider. Our reality of time is flexible, against yours being—let us call it—of a linear reality, and so your spider in “your now time” will not notice if we moved right through him and his web ten seconds prior in our purposefully altered time. And I ask you to simply comprehend this without ever fully understanding this during your entire lifetime.
This is just one of thousands of such messages that have been offered by these beings to people all over the world in the last few decades. These communications are part of a celestial mission sometimes known as the Correcting Time.
And here’s the reason for the time prompt: For a rather complex reason that is beyond the scope of this essay, there are exactly 1,111 of these quasi-angels in existence on our planet. In these times of planetary crisis, they want us to know of their presence, and they especially want to work with us on specific projects of service. And that is why they announce themselves with the 11:11 time prompt; it’s like a “branding” technique that alludes, somewhat humorously, to how many of them actually are located in their “half-way” realm just across the veil from us.
Many of us are aware that these beings are now prolific in their 11:11 outreach. I’ve seen one estimate claiming that one hundred million people are aware of this special prompt, and we know that thousands receive their transmitted messages through a variety of websites.
The Midwayers and the Urantia Revelation
We know of the existence of the unique midwayer beings from an equally unique source known as The Urantia Book. Also called the Urantia Revelation, this 2,097-page tome first published in 1955 claims to be a divine, epochal revelation to our planet. One of the many special purposes of this unusual text is to reveal the identities and attributes of the many orders of loving beings who reside in higher dimensions. The book focuses especially on those spirit beings—such as the midwayers—who interact with us routinely as part of the vast ministry of the unseen personalities in the spirit-realms to our troubled world. Another such order of beings are known as the seraphim, who labor unceasingly to serve human beings along with their helpers, the cherubim. The seraphim and cherubim can and do make frequent mind-to-mind contact with us as they minister to our spiritual needs, but only midwayer beings can contact our material realm directly, and they are incredibly fast and intelligent in all of their work.
I should stop and say a bit more about the source of my information about the identity of the midwayers. Since its publication in 1955, The Urantia Book has sold over a million copies in English, and has been translated into fourteen languages. Study groups are now spread out across the world, and celebrities have come forward to support this controversial work, including Deepak Chopra and Marianne Williamson.
It should be noted that the Urantia Revelation contains what it claims is the authentic celestial record of the life and teachings of Jesus. This nearly 800-page story comprises Part IV of the Urantia text, and provides a biography of Jesus of such depth, detail, and beauty that I have come to believe it exceeds the New Testament in religious significance. This is one reason I have been a student of the Urantia text for almost 40 years; it never ceases to fascinate and uplift me.
But this narrative of life and teachings of Jesus is only one facet of the revelation. The Urantia Book’steachings are very broad in scope—covering science, history, philosophy, and much else—and are framed within a futuristic evolutionary cosmology. As part of this cosmology, the book’s celestial authors reveal that the universe is highly ordered and is teaming with diverse forms of life both physical and spiritual in nature. The midwayer beings are depicted as that life form that is closest to us vibrationally. Because of their proximity to us, they are the only beings capable of physical interactions with objects in our world, such as car keys; thus, any example of a sudden, direct, miraculous, “hands-on” physical change in our environment—if it can’t be explained by reference to human or natural activity—is likely to include the work of midwayers.
My story of the lost keys is just one example of their efficient and timely physical ministry to me in times of need. And I’ve heard many similar stories from others who may or may not be in conscious contact with them, including instances of when midwayers stepped in to prevent automobile crashes and other serious accidents, or performed medical interventions. The great healer of Brazil known as John of God also works with midwayers, we are told.
According to the Urantia Revelation in Paper 77, these are some of the chief characteristics of these beings. The midwayers . . .
• “are about midway between . . . the mortals of the realms and the angelic orders; hence are they called midway creatures”
• are “invaluable to the seraphim in their work”
• “exist just outside the range of mortal vision”
• are able to “make, at will, physical contact with what humans call ‘material things.’ These unique creatures have certain definite powers over the things of time and space.”
Many of the classic miraculous phenomena ascribed in the past to angels were performed by the midway creatures. For example, The Urantia Book explains that when “an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors” and freed certain apostles of Jesus (see Acts 5:19 in the Bible), this was actually accomplished by a midwayer.
The midwayers have been around a long time. They are in fact the only order of celestial being that are permanent residents of our planet. They have a deep and abiding affection for Earth; among their many duties is the task of being our resident planetary historians.
They carry out innumerable other ad hoc tasks when directed to do so by their celestial superiors, or by their own initiative. They were in fact the authors of that lengthy section of The Urantia Book that presents the revealed life and teachings of Jesus, which is based on the celestial records the midwayers kept while Jesus walked the earth. This project was their own proposal, and I believe the narrative they have left us is a literary masterpiece. They walked with Jesus in Palestine, just out of the range of mortal vision, and helped Jesus in a variety of essential tasks, including miracles he performed.
The Origin and Meaning of the 11:11 Time Prompt
It turns out that, around the time when digital clocks first came into common use in the seventies, the always-progressive midwayers petitioned for and were granted the right to use the 11:11 time prompt to contact humans. (The prompt now includes many other repeating number sequences or times such as 12:12, 10:10, 22:22, 12:34, 2:22, 3:33, 4:44 or 5:55.) If you are seeing a time prompt very often, you are likely being alerted by these resident planetary helpers, and this is usually for a specific purpose or set of purposes they have in mind. The midwayers not only like to interact with digital clocks, but also have a general affinity for our electrical devices and can and do cause lights to flicker, doorbells or cell phones to ring, and a myriad of other interactions.
One well-known midwayer contactee is Christopher Maurus, who was a senior R & D engineer with over thirty years experience before he encountered the time prompt. Christopher tells his story of initial contact at his website, www.correctingtime.com: “Shortly after I suffered the loss of several family members, my father and two brothers, [I] began experiencing the 11:11 enigma. The frequency and variety of the number prompts I was experiencing fell well outside the normal curve of statistical probabilities to the point that I could no longer dismiss them as coincidence. I began searching for an explanation for the 11:11 phenomena where I discovered a group of other time prompted individuals like myself from all over the planet, from various countries, races, religions, and cultures.”
This search led Christopher to a crucial person in the 11:11 equation, one I had also encountered just a few years before Christopher did—a man who is almost certainly the most advanced experiencier of conscious interaction with the midwayers and their time prompt. This is the brilliant Australian named George Barnard, originally born in Holland and of French descent, who is the leader of something he calls the 11:11 Progress Group, which is an “interspecies alliance” —as Barnard calls it—of various humans and midwayers who are consciously in service to the planet. Barnard, who was born with advanced psychic abilities, not only has the ability to hear them and feel their presence going back to 1962, but has been able to see midwayers for decades. They have long been his most trusted companions.
Like Christopher, Barnard experienced the contact and the time prompts first, and learned about the Urantia Book connection later.
In my own case, I was aware of The Urantia Book long before I came to understand the significance of 11:11. I had not especially noticed the prompt before I met Barnard when he toured the United States in 2001 speaking to students of the Urantia Revelation. Fascinated by George’s story of his extensive encounters with the midwayers, I eventually became the publisher in 2002 of George Barnard’s first book on the phenomenon, entitled The Search for 11:11: A Journey into the Spirit World. (George later brought out a new edition under his own imprint in 2005, and followed it up in 2010 with In the Service of 1111: A Celestial / Mortal Alliance.) I have been experiencing the presence of the midwayers and their prompt ever since I met George. While not a “channeler” myself, I have enjoyed receiving their prompts, and have read hundreds of the messages and teachings from midwayers that are now streaming forth on the internet and especially through the vehicle of Barnard’s website, www.1111angels.net.
When Christopher discovered Barnard through his online research, he describes it as “the very thing I had long searched for my whole life. I quickly became familiar with the Urantia Book contents through hundreds of hours of study.” Christopher is now a contributor to the 11:11 Progress Group and is one of many receivers of channeled messages that go out to thousands around the world in four languages each day through Barnard’s subscriber list. Christopher explains the purpose of the group as he understands it: “Our function is to help those that are being prompted by the midwayers to understand what is happening to them and to educate them on how they can work with these and other celestial personalities to make a positive contribution and change our world by changing their lives and others. People from all walks of life, nations, cultures, and religions, are receiving the prompts . . .
“It was the ministry of George Barnard and the 11:11 Progress Group that led me to the truth and purpose of this phenomena, for which I am ever grateful. From there I was introduced to the teachings of The Urantia Book which really opened my eyes to the foundations of human destiny, the scope and purpose of universe affairs, and the hierarchy of universe government. It was this ‘tip of the iceberg’ understanding of mortal ascension, something that had completely eclipsed orthodox religion, that drove me to dig deeper and deeper into cosmic truths as they were unfolded to me. It seems that the more I searched, the greater the truths were laid out before me like a red carpet leading to the throne of grace itself.”
