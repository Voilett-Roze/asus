I use the guest wifi for our eldest daughter - if she doesn't get her chores done, she doesn't get the password for the day!

Rather than manually coming up with a suitable random password on a daily basis, I wanted a way that it would be set automatically every day, with the randomly generated phrase being emailed to myself and my wife so that we could provide it when we felt it had been earned.

While the below may not be perfect (it's a long time since I did scripting) I wanted to ensure it was something that could be set up without needing optware or entware installed.

The password is made up of a phrase selected from a text file (I used various band names) followed by a random three digit number. I'm only using one guest network, but this could be easily modified to pick three different passwords for three different networks, or even six. You would just need to assign new variables to phrasepwd after running the getrandomphrase procedure.

edit : following comments on the forums, I have added a couple of alternate functions that provide different ways of creating a random password. getrandopenssl uses the openssl rand option, and getpasswdme uses curl to access the https://passwd.me api. These may require additional software to be installed over & above the default busy box installation.

First of all, create the following as `/jffs/scripts/rpg-passgen.sh` and ensure you make it executable :

    #!/bin/sh
    
    FROM="login@gmail.com"
    AUTH="login@gmail.com"
    PASS="password"
    FROMNAME="Asus Router"
    TO="your@email.com other@email.com"
    
    # default password based on date if we cannot create one elsewhere
    datepasswd=`date +"%A%B%d"`

    rm /tmp/mail.txt

In the event that we cannot get a good phrase to create a password, we create one based on the date, so at least the password will change on a daily basis, even if it ends up being predictable! :)

I've configured the script to use gmail, but you could also amend this to use your ISP smtp server instead. Gmail requires the secure certificate to be installed in /jffs/configs/ - if you haven't got this, check the following post as the wget command referred to on the wiki doesn't work :

Next, create the following as /jffs/scripts/rpg-phrases.txt :

    greenday
    alicecooper
    ledzeppelin
    aerosmith
    ironmaiden
    metallica
    foofighters
    blacksabbath
    defleppard

These phrases are the basis for the password - I've chosen band names, but you could use your kids names or places or anything you want. Ensure that each phrase is at least 7 characters long (+3 for random number = min length of 10 characters) and that there are no blank lines. Try and have a reasonable number of entries in here, or you will end up with the same phrase being picked on a regular basis. My full phrases file now contains about 70 or 80 different bands! :)

To get this process to run at 4am each day, add the following into `/jffs/scripts/init-start` and make it executable :

    #!/bin/sh
    cru a ResetGuestPassword "0 4 * * * /jffs/scripts/rpg-passgen.sh"

This will set it up so that the script will be run at 4am every day.

Finally, to get this to run on each boot (rather than having to wait until 4am the next day) add the following to /jffs/scripts/services-start and make it executable it :

    #!/bin/sh
    sh /jffs/scripts/rpg-passgen.sh

Reboot your router, and you're done!
